<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Enjoy the mild, aromatic flavours of India in this easy meal. Tender strips of chicken get a light tandoori coating, which goes perfectly with fragrant garlic rice. A collection of zesty sides, including mint yoghurt and mango chutney, take this dinner to the next level.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 cloves</li>
    <li>1 packet chicken breast</li>
    <li>1 bunch mint</li>
    <li>1 punnet cheery tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 packet basmati rice</li>
    <li>1 tub tandoori paste</li>
    <li>1 packet greek-style yoghurt</li>
    <li>1 bag baby spinach leaves</li>
    <li>20g butter</li>
    <li>1.5 cup water</li>
    <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>Â½ tsp salt</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>    
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Finely chop the garlic. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter with a dash of olive oil over a medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until golden and fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the basmati rice, water (for the rice) and 1/2 the salt, stir, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to low and cover with a lid. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and keep covered until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the rice is cooking, slice the chicken breast into 1cm strips. In a medium bowl, combine the tandoori paste, remaining salt and a good drizzle of olive oil. Add the chicken strips and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Pick and finely chop the mint leaves. In a small bowl, combine the Greek yoghurt and 1/2 the mint. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Set aside.</li>    
    <li>Slice the cherry tomatoes in half. Roughly chop the baby spinach leaves. In a second medium bowl, combine the cherry tomatoes, spinach and remaining mint. Add the white wine vinegar and drizzle with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>In a large frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat. When the oil is hot, cook the tandoori chicken, in batches, tossing, until the chicken is browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>
        Divide the garlic rice and chicken tikka between bowls. Serve with the mint yoghurt and tomato salad</li>
